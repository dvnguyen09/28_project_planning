    "The broad question I will adress is question:\n",
    "1) What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?\n",
    "\n",
    "My specific question:\n",
    "Can age and hours played predict if players are subscribed to the newletter in the players dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my above research question is only looking at player traits such as age, hours played and subscription status, we only need to use the players dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since age and hours played are quantitative variables, they could be plotted against eachother in a scatter plot to see the trend and relationship. This way, we would be able to color the different states of subscription, and use classification to predict if the player is subscribed or not based on their age and hours played.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, I would wrangle the data to have only the relevant variables. I would select Age, played_hours, and subscribe. I would then convert these variables to the right type. I would make age an integer type variable. Since the played hours can reach up to 223, while the max age is 58, played hours has a much larger spread than the age variable. This data needs to be standardized with scale and center so that each variable is on the same scale and can contribute equally to the distance."
